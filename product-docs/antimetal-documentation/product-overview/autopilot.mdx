## How does Autopilot work? 

Autopilot auto-executes any recommendations in your account, preventing you from ever missing a savings opportunity. 

## Autopilot Configuration

Autopilot can be individually configured for each AWS account added to your Antimetal workspace. In addition, you can configure Autopilot to _only_ approve recommendations for specific regions.
