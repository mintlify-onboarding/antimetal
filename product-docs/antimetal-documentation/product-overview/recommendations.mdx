title: "Recommendations"
---

At the bottom of the dashboard, you should see a tabbed table. The first tab shows recommendations that are **awaiting approval** and have yet to be executed. To execute any of these recommendations manually, you can click on the "Buy"/"Sell" action button. The second tab shows recommendations that have already been **approved**, including information about when the recommendation was executed and who approved it.
