## Overview:

To start using Antimetal to optimize your cloud infrastructure, you'll want to create a data integration between AWS and Antimetal.

Antimetal integrates with your AWS account through the creation of a [cross-account IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id%5Froles%5Fcommon-scenarios%5Fthird-party.html). This allows us to gain read-only access to your organizationâ€™s cost data so that Antimetal Save can analyze your organizations cost data and resource metadata with our cost saving model (link to section about how we use AI to analyze data etc).

Once complete, our analysis allows users to manage, inspect, forecast, and model their AWS spend to ensure that they are fully optimizing both their performance and their cost savings.

**Integration Requests:** Antimetal will be launching support for additional cloud infrastructure providers in the near future. If you have a particular provider that you would like supported, please reach out to [support@antimetal.com](mailto:support@antimetal.com). Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated and will help us prioritize what is important to you.
