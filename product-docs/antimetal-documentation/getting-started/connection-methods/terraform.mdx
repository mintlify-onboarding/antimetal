description: "Antimetal provides a custom [Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/antimetal/antimetal/aws/latest) that allows you to create your Antimetal Cross-Account IAM Role directly within your infrastructure management workflow."
---

To get started:

1. Copy the provided Terraform snippet. It should look something like this:

```ruby
module "antimetal_role" {
  source = "antimetal/antimetal/aws"

  # Role name is a personal preference that suits best your needs.
  # It's used on Antimetal application to identify the account.
  role_name = "Development"

  # External ID should be random and securely generated.
  # DO NOT use this value, as its publicly available on this repository.
  external_id = "ynGu065M3Kee"
}
```

1. Add the snippet copied from the previous step to your existing Terraform configuration and run `terraform apply`.

2. Copy the Role ARN output from the `terraform apply` step and paste it in corresponding field on the Antimetal website.
