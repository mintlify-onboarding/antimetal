1. Click the button to "Connect via CloudFormation"

2. You should be redirected to a screen to create a CloudFormation stack named `AMSAVE`. Antimetal's CloudFormation stack creates a Cross Account IAM Role and associated IAM Policy.

3. Click "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names" and click "Create Stack".

4. Navigate back to the connect account screen on the Antimetal dashboard and you will see a loading screen. The stack will take 1-2 minutes to createâ€”once done, you should see a message that the account was successfully connected.
