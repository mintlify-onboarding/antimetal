2. Copy the displayed CLI command and paste it into your terminal. To use this onboarding method, you should have [AWS CLI ](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)already configured on your machine (or one of your remote machines).

<Note>
    The CLI command runs the same CloudFormation stack creation script as the CloudFormation onboarding.
