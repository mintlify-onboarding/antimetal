description: "To connect your AWS account, Antimetal uses a “[Cross Account IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id%5Froles%5Fcommon-scenarios%5Fthird-party.html)”.

[Cross-account IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id%5Froles%5Fcommon-scenarios%5Fthird-party.html) allow customers to securely grant access to AWS resources in their account to a third party, like Antimetal while retaining the ability to control and audit who is accessing your AWS account.
