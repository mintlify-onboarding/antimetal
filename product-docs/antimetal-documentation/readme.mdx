## About Us:

We are a team of passionate DevOps engineers that grew frustrated with the current tooling for AWS cost optimization and started working toward solutions.

We started speaking to dozens of other engineers and teams and learned how widespread this issue was. As a result, in late 2022, Antimetal was born.

## Overview

It's free to onboard and run a Savings Analysis to see what our savings recommendations are for your account.

To start, Navigate to the Savings Analysis page and follow the steps provided. If you're a startup, you can qualify for a [free startup plan](/product-docs/antimetal-documentation/getting-started/billing/startup-program), and any company doing over $1 million in annual AWS spend qualifies for the [enterprise plan](/product-docs/antimetal-documentation/getting-started/billing/enterprise-plan).
