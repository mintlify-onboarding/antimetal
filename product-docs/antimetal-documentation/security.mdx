## **Security**

As an infrastructure tool that requires access to your cloud provider we understand there may be questions, concerns and necessary clarification around our own infrastructure, processes and procedures. We use Antimetal ourselves to make sure that our security concerns are aligned with those of our customers.

**Note:** We take security seriously. If at anytime you have any questions or recommendations for us, send us an email at [security@antimetal.com](mailto:support@antimetal.com).
